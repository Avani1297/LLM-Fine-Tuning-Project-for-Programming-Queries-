## Overview
Utilized Hugging Face and Vast.ai to fine-tune a large language model on Stack Overflow datasets, improving its proficiency in generating accurate programming-related responses and insights, aiding in the development of a more context-aware AI assistant
## Introduction
For this project, I chose the data source of Stack Overflow, a comprehensive repository of programming-related questions and answers. It is a platform where developers share coding issues they face and receive guidance from the community. By training a Large Language Model (LLM) with this data, the model can offer relevant and accurate answers to programming questions, thereby assisting users more efficiently.
The fine-tuned model aims to tackle the challenge of quickly finding solutions within the vast sea of programming questions. In the fast-paced world of software development, timely problem-solving is crucial. This model will aid in speeding up the troubleshooting process, ensuring swift and accurate resolution of coding issues, thereby enhancing efficiency in software development.
## Implementation
To implement this project, the following steps were taken:

#### Data Preprocessing:
  Cleaned the data by removing irrelevant information, handling missing values, and normalizing the text.

#### Model Setup:
  1. Used a pre-trained LLM (e.g., "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf") and integrated LoRA to manage the model's information efficiently.
  2. Applied QLoRA to quantize the model, reducing computational costs while maintaining performance.
  3. Configured BitsAndBytes for efficient training with 4-bit precision.

#### Instruction Fine-Tuning:
  1. Provided the model with specific commands and instructions to guide it in answering programming questions accurately.
  2. Adjusted the model weights based on the decomposed matrices from LoRA, allowing for efficient updates.
     
#### Training and Evaluation:
  1. Trained the model on the preprocessed Stack Overflow dataset using the SFTTrainer, with the following hyperparameters:
     ###### a. per_device_train_batch_size: 2
     ###### b. gradient_accumulation_steps: 1
     ###### c. learning_rate: 2e-4
     ###### d. num_train_epochs: 1
     ###### e. max_grad_norm: 0.3
     ###### f. warmup_ratio: 0.03
     ###### g. lr_scheduler_type: "cosine"  
  2. Continuously evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy and response relevance.
  3. Iteratively fine-tuned the model to ensure it could provide accurate and context-aware answers.

#### Deployment:
Deployed the fine-tuned model as a web service, allowing users to input programming questions and receive accurate, context-aware answers.
